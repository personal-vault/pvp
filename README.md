# Personal Vault Project PVP[^1]

😌 Imagine having all your digital life, in your possession, indexed and searchable.
🤖 Now, add AI on top and be able to ask it anything about your life. Find trends, detect habits, find the bright and the dark spots.
🧳 Your digital legacy, completely yours. All your photos, notes, posts, projects, chats, everything.
✨ This is a project I've been pondering for a while now, but actually giving it more thought now. I finally have words on paper.
